# Portfolio [WIP]
I always wanted an interactive Crowd portfolio where, instead of being just a few seconds of curated footage, visitors could actually stress-test the behaviors I usually use in my crowds. Scarier for sure, but I feel it would help visitors see, firsthand, the intricacy in the work I'm producing.

## Goals
- Display a decent amount of visually distinct characters on screen.
- Create an interesting environment for these characters to interact with that showcase the typical crowd behaviors.

## How to manage lots of characters on screen
Obviously, it's Crowd, you need a lot of characters--it's also the scariest part. I want my website to run well on most computers and smartphones. The last thing I want is to lose an opportunity because my website was lagging on a recruiters' phone. Here's what I did to overcome these hurdles :

- Stylized over realistic
- Instanced characters
- GL Shaders
